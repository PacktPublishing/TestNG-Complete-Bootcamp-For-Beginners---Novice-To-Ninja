TestNG is one of the best testing frameworks available today. It helps the automation tester to focus on writing and implementing test cases, so that they can concentrate on testing the functionality of the application and the logistics of running, monitoring and reporting is managed by the TestNG framework. This course includes a wide range of topics from TestNG annotations, different kind of assertions, running a test suite, running tests in a desired sequence, grouping related tests, understanding dependent tests, preserver order of execution, reading parameters from xml files, data providers (run test methods for multiple data sets), TestNG listeners, TestNG reporters (Logging), TestNG HTML reports. All materials including code files. We assume that students have no experience in testing frameworks and start every topic from scratch and basics. Examples are all real time in order to enable you to understand how different annotations can be utilized, that will give you idea of industry level framework and give you confidence.
